# About this project

**this project is practice-purpose only**, my goal is to replicate [Messenger's](https://www.messenger.com/) common features. I used [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for the entire backend and [React](https://react.dev/) with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) on frontend.

## Collaborations

This project is open for collaborations! You can fork this repo and clone it to your machine then run `npm install` to install dependencies. You also need to create a supabase project [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard), then create an `.env` file that contains the following:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your project's anon key>
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your project's url>
```

feel free to open issues [here](https://github.com/retsaeiouu/mensahe-app/issues) if you need help with something, thanks alot! ðŸ«¶ðŸ«¶
